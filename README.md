# HR_Analytics_PowerBi_Dashboard

📊 Excited to share the latest project I've been learning on as a Data Analyst! 🚀


🔍 I've developed an insightful HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, shedding light on key trends and insights within our workforce.


📈 From extracting extensive data from Excel to implementing advanced data cleaning techniques, this project has been a journey of transforming raw data into actionable insights.

📊 The dashboard features various visualizations, including:

📊 Card charts showcasing employee counts, average age, and average salaries.

📈 Attrition analysis by age using bar charts.

🍩 Attrition breakdown by education level with donut charts.

📈 Attrition trends over time by experience level displayed through line charts.

🔍 Through this dashboard, we've gained valuable insights into employee attrition patterns and factors influencing workforce dynamics. These insights will inform strategic HR decisions aimed at enhancing employee satisfaction and retention.
